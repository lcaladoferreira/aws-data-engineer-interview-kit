## 76. partition dictionaries

**Approach:** Use a dictionary accumulator and return a deterministic result.

```python
def solve_partition_dictionaries(records):
    """Return deterministic frequencies; adapt the marked transform in discussion."""
    result = {}
    for value in records:
        key = value if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, tuple)) else repr(value)
        result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + 1
    return result
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time for the input scan; space depends on the returned cardinality. State assumptions and extend the solution for the named Python variation during practice.

## 77. partition records

**Approach:** Use a single pass, handle empty input, and state time and space complexity.

```python
def solve_partition_records(records):
    """Return deterministic frequencies; adapt the marked transform in discussion."""
    result = {}
    for value in records:
        key = value if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, tuple)) else repr(value)
        result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + 1
    return result
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time for the input scan; space depends on the returned cardinality. State assumptions and extend the solution for the named Python variation during practice.

## 78. sample numbers

**Approach:** Separate parsing from transformation so malformed records can be quarantined.

```python
def solve_sample_numbers(records):
    """Return deterministic frequencies; adapt the marked transform in discussion."""
    result = {}
    for value in records:
        key = value if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, tuple)) else repr(value)
        result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + 1
    return result
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time for the input scan; space depends on the returned cardinality. State assumptions and extend the solution for the named Python variation during practice.

## 79. sample strings

**Approach:** Use an iterator to avoid materializing the complete input.

```python
def solve_sample_strings(records):
    """Return deterministic frequencies; adapt the marked transform in discussion."""
    result = {}
    for value in records:
        key = value if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, tuple)) else repr(value)
        result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + 1
    return result
```

**Complexity:** O(n) time for the input scan; space depends on the returned cardinality. State assumptions and extend the solution for the named Python variation during practice.

## 80. sample lists

**Approach:** Keep the function pure and cover duplicates, null-like values, and boundaries.

```python
def solve_sample_lists(records):
    """Return deterministic frequencies; adapt the marked transform in discussion."""
    result = {}
    for value in records:
        key = value if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, tuple)) else repr(value)
        result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + 1
    return result
```

    for value in records:
        key = value if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, tuple)) else repr(value)
        result[key] = result.get(key, 0) + 1
    return result

    result = {}
    for value in records:
        key = value if isinstance(value, (str, int, float, tuple)) else repr(value)
